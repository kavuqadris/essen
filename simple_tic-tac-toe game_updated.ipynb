        "I let the players choose the board size instead of fixing it at 3×3. After they enter a number like 3 or 5, the program creates a square board of that size using a list of lists filled with underscores. I also added input checks so that if someone types something that’s not a positive integer, the game shows a clear message and asks again instead of crashing.\n",

On each turn, the player sees the current board and is asked to enter a row and column. The prompt updates based on the chosen board size, and I use try/except plus range checks to make sure the input is a number, within the valid range, and that the chosen spot isn’t already taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "To decide the result, I wrote a function that checks rows, columns, and diagonals to see if one player has three in a row, or if the board is full with no winner, in which case it’s a draw."
